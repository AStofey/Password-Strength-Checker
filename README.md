# Password-Strength-Checker
This repository contains a small program that checks the strength of an entered password based primarily off of the length. It also takes into account whether or not the password contains numbers and symbols.

A very strong password must be longer than 14 characters and contain at least one symbol AND one number. Any password 7 characters or less is considered very weak!

This program is loosely based off of the guidelines found at: https://bitwarden.com/blog/how-long-should-my-password-be/

When this program is run, it will ask the user for a password. Once a password is entered, the program will then score the password.

This tool is for educational use only and should not be used for securing sensitive information!

This tool does not currently store the entered passwords. Please use this tool responsibly. Users of this program should not change this program to store sensitive information. This program was created for educational purposes and to help users determine whether their passwords would be considered strong and help them learn how to create stronger passwords. Changing this program to store sensitive information would be considered unethical and malicious.
